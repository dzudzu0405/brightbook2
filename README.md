# BrightBook Studio

An educational activity book product-kit creator powered by a local Ollama model.

BrightBook is positioned as a low-ticket, one-time front-end offer with optional OTO upgrades. Each generation creates a publishing kit, not just a prompt pack: page prompts, answer keys, cover direction, marketplace listing assets, quality checks, series ideas, and a launch checklist.

## Requirements

- Ollama
- Model `gemma3:4b`
- Node.js 22+

## Run

```powershell
node server.js
```

Open:

- Landing page: `http://127.0.0.1:4180/`
- App: `http://127.0.0.1:4180/app.html`
- Admin: `http://127.0.0.1:4180/admin.html`

## Tests

```powershell
npm test
```

Runs `node --test` against `test/`, which currently covers the word-search and maze puzzle generators (grid shape, word placement correctness, maze solvability). These are pure functions with no server/database dependency, so the tests run without Ollama or the HTTP server.

## Optional Configuration

```powershell
$env:OLLAMA_MODEL="gemma3:4b"
$env:OLLAMA_URL="http://127.0.0.1:11434"
$env:USE_OLLAMA_GENERATION="1"
$env:PORT="4180"
node server.js
```

The application does not call the OpenAI API. Project data is stored in `data/brightbook.db`.

By default, BrightBook uses local Ollama generation for stronger page concepts and image prompts. Set `USE_OLLAMA_GENERATION=0` only when you want instant Fast Product Kit mode for demos.

## Admin, Users, One-Time Plans, Features, and Usage History

Open the admin panel:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:4180/admin.html
```

Default admin token:

```text
brightbook-admin
```

For production, set your own token before starting the server:

```powershell
$env:ADMIN_TOKEN="change-this-token"
node server.js
```

The app now includes:

- `plans`: one-time front-end / OTO tiers and pricing.
- `features`: configurable feature keys such as `activity.coloring`, `quantity.30`, or `advanced.guide-character`.
- `plan_features`: which features each plan can access.
- `users`: customer email, plan, status, access token, optional custom limit.
- `usage_events`: every successful generation is recorded as history only. It is not used as a credit system.

Customer access tokens are sent with generation requests through the `x-user-token` header. You can also open the customer app with:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:4180/?token=USER_TOKEN_HERE
```

The default demo user uses `demo-token`.

### Feature-based access model

BrightBook does not need to sell credits or monthly subscriptions. A one-time plan works by enabling or disabling features.

Examples:

- Starter can include `activity.coloring`, `activity.word-search`, `quantity.25`, basic exports, and starter themes.
- Pro can additionally include `activity.maze`, `activity.tracing`, `activity.matching`, `activity.counting`, more themes, `quantity.30`, and advanced direction.
- Publisher can unlock `activity.learning-worksheet`, save projects, listing assets, quality checks, series planning, and launch checklist output.
- You can create your own keys in the admin panel, such as `export.pdf` or `mode.template-engine`.

The backend currently enforces generation-related feature keys:

- `activity.ACTIVITY_TYPE`
- `quantity.25`
- `quantity.30`
- `advanced.custom-direction`
- `advanced.learning-goal`
- `advanced.guide-character`

Other keys can be created now and wired into future UI/API features later.
